# Predicting customer defaulting on a loan:<br><br>Home Credit Group classification algorithms analysis

Roberto Andrade Mart√≠nez

### Summary
<br>

Given Home Credit's default risk [data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data), this project aims to build a classification algorithm that will predict whether or not a client will default on a loan. Secondly, due to the business nature of the problem, the project also aims to analyze different models to try and explain their financial implications when optimizing for different metrics. Finally, the project will aim to not only optimize statistical performance but also computing power efficiency: a marginal improvement in accuracy may not be an overall gain given the time the model takes to perform.

As the objective of the project is only to predict, at no point will we touch on output interpretability nor try to point out the most prominent features that drive defaulting on a loan.

In order to accomplish this we will use Python and in particular [Scikit learn 1.1.3](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for both data processing as well as model implementation. For Gradient Boosted Trees, we will use the [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) package.
