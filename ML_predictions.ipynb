We will use the processed data created from the data_preparation.ipynb file, which is a csv named 'train_data_processed.csv'.\n",

    "The objective of the models is to accurately predict if a client with certain characteristics will default on a loan when asking for it. As we do not know the associated costs with a client not paying back nor the benefits of a client repaying, we will focus on Area Under Curve as the performance metric.\n",
